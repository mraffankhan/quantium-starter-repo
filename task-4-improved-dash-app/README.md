# Task 4: Improved Dash Application

## Purpose
This task involves enhancing the basic Dash application (from Task 3) with interactivity and improved UI design.

## Improvements
1.  **Region Filter**: Added `dcc.RadioItems` to filter sales data by specific regions (North, East, South, West, or All).
2.  **Callback**: Implemented a Dash callback to dynamically update the chart based on the selected region.
3.  **Styling**: Applied CSS styles (inline) to improve readability, spacing, and visual appeal.
4.  **Annotations**: Added a clear vertical line marker for the price increase date.

## How to Run
```bash
python app.py
```
